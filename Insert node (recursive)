You have been given an array 'A' of length 'N'. Sort the array in non-decreasing order using Insertion Sort.
Note:
You have to implement 2 functions, insertionSort() and insertNumberAt().
The function insertionSort() is the main function you have to implement.
The function insertNumberAt() is the helper function, which inserts the number at the given position to it's correct position.
Input format:
The first line contains an Integer 'N', the length of the array.

The second line of contains 'N' integers, the array 'A'.
Output format:
Print the array 'A' in sorted order.

You don't need to print explicitly, it has been taken care of. Just implement the function.
Constraints:
1 <= 'N' <= 1000
1 <= 'A[I]' <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
6
4 3 8 4 6 5
Sample Output 1:
3 4 4 5 6 8
Sample Input 2:
4
5 6 7 8
Sample Output 2:
5 6 7 8
